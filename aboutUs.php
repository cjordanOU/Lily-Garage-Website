                <h3> Who is Lily? </h3>
                <p>Lily’s started off as nothing but a girl, a grill, and a dream. In her childhood home she would always lick the maple tree in the field, 
                    until one day she realized that syrup would be great on pancakes. From there, her culinary career began to grow into the stunning legacy 
                    it has become today. Rubbing pancakes on the maple tree to get that wonderful taste, cooking burgers on the hood of a semi on a hot day, 
                    and putting just a little bit of motor oil in her pasta to add that lovely kick, she made the very first Lily’s Little Garage Location in Climax MI. </p>
                <br>
                <p>At Lily’s Lil’ Garage, our goal is for good tasting food to hit you like a Mack Truck. We make all of our food with 
                    the precision and care of a mechanic working on a car. Lily’s started off with nothing but a garage, a grill, and a maple tree out back. 
                    From there we stretched into a multi-location franchise spread throughout Michigan. We also have a location in Japan where we source our 
                    A5 Wagyu Beef for our signature Radiator Burger.</p>
